------------------------------------------------------------------

What is it:
A widget to display large sets of data as dots (or lines). Different data
sets will have different colors, you may change colors and style of the data
The widget gives the possibility to zoom into and out of the data and to 
scroll around. It also offers a grid like on an oscilloscope.

The homepage of the GtkDatabox is

http://www.eudoxos.de/gtk/gtkdatabox/

The only available documentation right now are the comments in the 
header file "gtk/gtkdatabox.h" and the examples in the folder 
"examples". If that does not help, do not hesitate to contact me, flames 
being accepted but not necessarily answered :-)
