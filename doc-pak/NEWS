Version 2.0.7 03/23/2009
   Buffer Management
      *Added capability to automatically save the capture buffers and load them

      *Added Open, Save, and Save-As dialogs, functionality to store buffers

   HCI 
      *Put more user friendly name onto Transfer Function Button (formerly
      H(z)
      *Changed Buffer names to not start at 0, but 1, updated accelerators
      accordingly

      the menus for some reason
   Keyboard Accelerators
      *Thanks to Andreas for fixing the Mac key accelerators and suggesting the
      use of Control keys instead of Alt keys

12/20/2008
   Major GUI and UI update!

   *Delay function now resets delay before each capture, resulting in a much
      more intuitive delay finding procedure.

   *Rewrote buffer capture interface so that it makes more sense and works
      consistently.

   *Rewrote keyboard shortcuts so they don't interfere with the Avg gain.

   *Added default zoom button to return to original zoom settings.

   *Added inserted delay size status on the status bar.

   *Added "about" and "general help" windows

   *TODO: add pink noise generator and ability to save buffers to a file.
      This will allow soundcards with only one input channel to do the transfer
      function.
