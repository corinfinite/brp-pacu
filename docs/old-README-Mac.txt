Instructions

To install BRP-PACU, drag the BRP-PACU icon into the Application folder.
This application is not code-signed. To open it for the first time in Lion or Mountain-Lion with the Gatekeeper activated, right-click (or control-click) on the icon, chose "Open", and then "Open" again.

If Jack-OS X is not present or not running, a warning will appear, and Jack Pilot will open. CLick on "Start" on the JackPilot window, then on "Continue"" on the warning box.

If Jack Pilot does not open, this means that Jack-OS X is not installed correctly.
