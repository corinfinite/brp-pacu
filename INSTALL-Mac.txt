You should first download and install:

Jack-OS X from http://www.jackosx.com/

To install BRP-PACU, drag the BRP-PACU icon into the Application folder.
Then double-click on BRP-PACU to start.

If Jack-OS X is not present or not running, a warning will appear, and Jack Pilot will open. CLick on "Start" on the JackPilot window, then on "Continue"" on the warning box.

If Jack Pilot does not open, this means that Jack-OS X is not installed correctly.
