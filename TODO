#Maybe a menu item with an accelerator for Pink Noise

The program should not quit when Jack does not start but stay on hold until jack is fixed and/or started manually. Also, it should not crash when Jack is stopped manually.

Change delay buffer to not be dependent on N-FFT so that the maximum system delay is not dependednt on N_FFT and Sample Rates

#Achieve Compilation on mingw

There should be a warning, and not buff_store.brp ceated.

"Resize" lets the line go out of the window

Sample Rate should be displayed somewhere

Window size, smoothing, and avg_num should be changeable in the UI

Make guiY less points, so drawing requires less CPU.

Suggestions:
1) You do not need to hit "OK". Just check every second or so and destroy the message when jack_init() returns 0.

2) The message should give a reason: jack_init() should return an error code instead of only 0 or 1. For example:
0= OK
1 = Unable to connect to JACK server
2 = No more JACK ports available
3 = Cannot activate client
4 = No physical capture ports
5 = Cannot connect input ports
6 = Cannot connect output ports

This can then be passed to the message using a case clause.

3) The message for Mac users could be more informative, such as:

"Jack initialization Error. BRP_PACU failed to start\n \
Reason: %s.\n \
Make sure that JackOSX has been installed.\n \
Open JackPilot. You will find it in in the Jack folder within the Applications folder.\n \
You should first read the Jack-OSX manual. It will be found under the Help menu of the JackPilot.\n \
Configure JACK according to the Special Intel Mac instructions on page 12 - 13."

where %s is filled with the messages above.

#Change const N to another name like N_FFT because it may cause symbol collisions

#Change gui to not use N datapoints because this drastically increases processor usage to draw points that aren't visible or useful

#Messages written with printf and fprintf to the console will not be read by the average user. These messages are only useful for debugging. Messages that are meant for the user should appear in alert windows.
